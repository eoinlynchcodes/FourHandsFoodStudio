    <h1><u>About</u></h1>
    <p>
                4 Hands is the creation of duo Rose Greene and Margaux Dejardin, both
                highly knowledgeable in food, nutrition, farming and health, developed
                their business to fit their lifestyle and ethos. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Coming from a
                background in world renowned kitchens Rose came to a point where she
                needed a change - mentally, physically and emotionally. Margaux forged
                a life in food later in life, both determined to create their own path
                in life. After taking time to think, share, learn and really determine
                what role they wanted to play and where they wanted to establish their
                business, Ireland became the natural choice, it happened almost
                accidently, but has proven the natural place to be. Starting small was
                always the way they wanted to build 4 Hands, allowing growth at a
                sustainable pace for both themselves whilst supporting the natural
                progression of a healthy business.
