        The want to engage with and educate people was the driving force for
        the creation of 4 Hands, Rose and Margaux have gone through a time of
        change in order to create a more balanced and grounded lifestyle for
        themselves, while doing what they truly believe in. Rose and Margaux
        wish to share their knowledge and help others to introduce beneficial
        changes to their diet, lifestyle and daily habits, not only for their
        wellbeing but for the health of our environment and all it supports.
        To be able to source and make nutritious food for yourself and the
        people you care for is the most fundamentally important skill in life,

        environment, allowing for exchange and empowerment. Link to workshops
