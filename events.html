        Rose expresses her creative cooking in pop up style events, sharing her
        idea of the future of food. 4 Hands dining experiences create
        conversation in health, farming practices, nutrition, regenerative
        agriculture and pre-digestion. Rose’s cooking is humble, natural and
        above all flavourful and nutritious.
        <br><br>
        Techniques to increase the
        nutrition of foods are used while also making them easier to digest,
        such as fermentation, sprouting, dehydration and slow cooking. This
        unique style, is mainly focused on plant based cooking but not solely,
        the use of ethically raised animal protein plays a major role in Rose’s
        idea of sustainable eating. 
        <br><br>
        A deep respect for the entirety of an animal
        is paramount, traditional eating habits reflex this and Rose’s cooking
        shines a light on this by working with whole carcasses. 4 Hands belief
        is that we should be collectively stepping away from over consumption of
        animal protein, instead turning to eating smaller amounts less often of
        well raised produce from a known and trusted source. 
        <br><br>
        Since 2014 Rose and
        Margaux have begun a transformation of their diets, both becoming great
        advocates of the health and emotional benefits of a more natural diet.
        Margaux shares her love of natural wine by sourcing from wine makers
        that work with a similar mindset to 4 Hands, in a world of overly
        processed food and drink, Margaux’s alcohol pairing is a celebration of
        raw and minimal intervention wine. 
        <br><br>
        Alongside these rare wines stand
        selected spirits and beer from around Ireland, giving a one off
        experience. Non-alcoholic pairings are developed closely alongside the
        menu, made from the extensive 4 Hands larder of the seasons including
        fermented vegetable juices, tonics and kombucha, their complexity rivals
        that of their alcoholic counterparts. 4 Hands events are communal
        experiences, focused on bringing people together to share food and to
        enjoy the complexity and wonder of our environment, while being cared
        for by Rose and Margaux.
