        <h1><u>About</u></h1>
        <p>
            4 Hands is the creation of duo Rose Greene and Margaux Dejardin, both
            highly knowledgeable in food, nutrition, farming and health, developed
            their business to fit their lifestyle and ethos. Coming from a
            background in world renowned kitchens Rose came to a point where she
            needed a change - mentally, physically and emotionally. Margaux forged
            a life in food later in life, both determined to create their own path
            in life.

            After taking time to think, share, learn and really determine
            what role they wanted to play and where they wanted to establish their
            business, Ireland became the natural choice, it happened almost
            accidently, but has proven the natural place to be. Starting small was
            always the way they wanted to build 4 Hands, allowing growth at a
            sustainable pace for both themselves whilst supporting the natural
            progression of a healthy business.
